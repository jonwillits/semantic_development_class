Syllabus for PSYC 593: Seminar in Semantic Development

# 1.	Course Info

**Instructor**: Jon Willits
**Email**: jwillits@illinois.edu
**Office** Hours: By appointment

# 2.	Course Description and Learning Objectives
In this seminar we will be reading and discussing papers about semantic development in children. These studies will cover theoretical, methodological, computational, and empirical phenomena. We read papers about a range of topics, including word learning, concept development, category learning, reasoning and inference, and sentence comprehension and production.

# 3.	Course Requirements and Grading
### Assignments
This course can be taken for either 2 or 4 credits. All students are requried to
- Read the weekly readings
- Answer to weekly assigned questions about the readings
- Come up with one question of their own about each reading

In addition, students who take the course for 4 credits are required to write a term paper by the end of the semester. That paper should be on a topic that integrates readings across the entire semester, and the topic must be approved by the end of week 10. The paper must be 3-5 pages (single spaced, size 12 font with 1" margins), not including references.
Each question and answer (4 per week * 14 weeks) are worth 5 points each. Your lowest 4 are dropped (allowing, for example, you to not turn in questions one week), for a total of 4*13*5=260 points.
For students enrolled for 4 credits, the final paper is worth an additional 140 points (35% of the grade), resulting in 400 total points.

### Grading Scale
A   90-100
B   80- <90
C   70- <80
D   60- <70
F   Below 60

# 4.	Academic Integrity Policy
Each student in this course is expected to abide by the University Code of Academic Integrity. In-class participation, quizzes, homework, and examinations are expected to be the student’s own work. You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts. Students are welcome to share notes taken during class or as a part of reading course materials. You can give help or receive help from other students on lab reports and reading checks. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of an assignment done by someone else, in the form of an electronic or paper copy of the other student’s work (with the exception of lab reports, which can be done and shared as a group). Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

# 5.	Accommodation Policy
All necessary and helpful accommodations will be made for students needing special help who are registered with Disability Resources and Education Services. For more information, visit the university accommodation website. We are available to discuss questions regarding appropriate academic accommodations that may be required.
